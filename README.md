StereoVision-ADCensus
=====================
This is a master student project realized at the robotics laboratory of the Westphalian University of Applied Science.
With the software in this repository you can calibrate single cameras, a stereo system, calculate disparity maps and evaluate your data. It's a all in one package for stereo vision! The software runs under windows and linux and is written in C++.

Based on the following libraries:
* OpenCV
* BOOST
* libConfig
* PCL

Projects in this package:
* IntrinsicExtrinsicCalib
* ImageRectify 
* ADCensusBM 
* PictureOverlay 
* OpenCVBM 
* evalDisp
